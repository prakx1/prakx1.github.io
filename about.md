I am a software engineer with a background in computer science and a B.Tech degree.
I work on data-intensive applications and enjoy improving performance across application code and databases.

This blog is where I share practical notes from what I build and learn.
Most posts are about backend engineering, system design, and lessons from real projects.

Outside work, I follow football, read philosophy, and I am learning guitar.
