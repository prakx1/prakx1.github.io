      <h1>Prakash Singh</h1>

      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a computer science background and a B.Tech degree.
        I work mostly on backend systems and data-heavy applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is my working notebook. I publish short notes from architecture decisions,
        production debugging, performance work, and lessons learned while building.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside work I follow football, read philosophy, and keep practicing guitar.
