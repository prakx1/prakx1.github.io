      <h1>Prakash Singh</h1>

      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a background in computer science and a B.Tech degree.
        I work on data-intensive applications and enjoy improving performance across application
        code and databases.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is where I share practical notes from what I build and learn.
        Most posts are about backend engineering, system design, and lessons from real projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside work, I follow football, read philosophy, and I am learning guitar.
