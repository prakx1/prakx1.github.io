    <h1>Prakash Singh</h1>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer with a background in computer science and a B.Tech degree.
      I work on data-intensive applications and enjoy improving performance across application
      code and databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      This blog is where I share practical notes from what I build and learn.
      Most posts are about backend engineering, system design, and lessons from real projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside work, I follow football, read philosophy, and I am learning guitar.
